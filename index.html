      <h1>Let's M-Check your cycle!</h1>
      <p> We'll start at the rear wheel and work our way through the M-check to ensure you're safe to ride. This is great check if you've gotten the bike out of storage and need to give it a good once over. At the end you have a nice report that you can consider yourself or take to a mechanic to get further help.</p>

  <h2>Is your wheel attached properly?</h2>
  <p class="question-title">Whether you have a quick release or the wheel is bolted on, it needs to be secure. If you have a quick release, make sure the word "close" is visible and it's firmly pushed on towards the frame. If you have a nut and bolt make sure the nut is tight on both sides. How would you say your wheel is attached?"</p>
